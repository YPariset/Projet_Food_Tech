A PHP e-commerce web application.

1. To set this web application, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server.
2. Next open PHPMyAdmin, create a database and import the Alimentation.sql file. This will generate tables in your database on your server.
3. Once this is done, go to the url of your localhost and it should be up and running.

Enjoy!
